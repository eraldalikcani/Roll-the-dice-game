# Roll-the-dice

/
The user rolls the dice, it generates a random dice roll and it displays it.

--If it is any number(not 1), then add dice roll to the current score and display the score.
--If it is 1, switch the player.

When user holds score, add the current score to total score.
--If it reaches score>=100, then YOU ARE THE WINNER!
--Else switch the player

When we reset the game, we set all scores to 0 and we set the player 1 as a starting player
